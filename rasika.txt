Embark on a flavorful journey with Rasika, the heart of Mayabati's culinary magic. From the very beginning, Rasika weaves her enchantment, 
utilizing a symphony of ingredients to create a delightful culinary experience.

Textual Ingredients:

Intents Dataset: Rasika starts by delving into the rich repository of intents. These are the building blocks of her culinary knowledge, 
containing patterns and responses that guide her interactions with users.

Recipes Dataset: The recipe dataset provides Rasika with a treasure trove of culinary wisdom. Each recipe becomes a thread in the tapestry of her understanding, allowing her to offer insightful guidance.
Text Processing Magic:

Tokenizer Spell: Rasika employs a tokenizer to translate textual patterns into numerical sequences. This spell transforms words into a language comprehensible to her neural network, paving the way for deeper insights.
The Spell of Embedding:

Embedding Elixir: Rasika uses embedding layers to infuse each word with meaning. This magical elixir represents the essence of ingredients and cooking techniques, creating a multi-dimensional space where culinary wisdom flourishes.
The Dance of Attention:

Self-Attention Ballet: Rasika's self-attention mechanism is a dance of focus and awareness. Much like a child captivated by the details, this mechanism allows her to prioritize and absorb the nuances of each word, creating a richer understanding.
Layers of Wisdom:

Block by Block Enlightenment: Rasika's wisdom deepens with each block of multi-head self-attention and feed-forward networks. These layers of enchantment refine her comprehension, bringing forth a model that evolves through epochs of training.
Culinary Memory:

Global Pooling Potency: Rasika's memory structure, akin to a child's, is honed through global average pooling. It's a reflection of her diverse experiences, creating a reservoir of culinary knowledge that she draws upon with each interaction.
The Final Culinary Spell:

Softmax Symphony: In the grand finale, Rasika casts the softmax spell. It transforms her refined understanding into probabilities, allowing her to predict the most likely intent based on the user's input.
As Rasika evolves through the training journey, she becomes more than a model; she becomes a culinary companion, ready to share the joy of cooking and the magic of Mayabati's food processing chatbot. From the start to the sizzle, Rasika's culinary incantation is a testament to the fusion of technology and tradition.
